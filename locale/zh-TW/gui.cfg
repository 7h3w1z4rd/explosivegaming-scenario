welcome-roles=We run a custom role system to help protect the work of others. As a result you may not be able to use your deconstruction planner yet or drop item on the groud. Roles also give you access to some custom features such as adding tasks to our task list or making new warp points.\nYou have been assigned the roles: __1__
welcome-chat=Chatting can be difficult for new players because it’s different than other games! It’s very simple, the button you need to press is the “GRAVE/TILDE” key (which is located under the “ESC key”) - If you would like to change the key, go to your Controls tab in options.\nThe setting you need to change is “Toggle chat (and Lua console)” you currently have it set to "__CONTROL__toggle-console__"

rules-6=Before removing major parts of the factory tell other players why you are removing it.
rules-7=Do not cause unnecessary lag by placing/removing tiles with bots or using active provider chests, if think some thing might cause lag please ask staff first.
rules-8=Do not walk in random directions with no reason, this is to reduce map download times.
rules-9=Do not use speakers on global or with alerts without prior permission, no one wants to hear your music at full volume without knowing where the off switch is.
rules-10=Do not rotate belts, deactivate belts with wires, or cause production to stop without good reason, this goes for inserters and spliters as well.
rules-11=Do not make train roundabouts. Other loops such as RoRo stations are allowed.
rules-12=When using trains, use the same size other players have used, many players use 1-2-1, 2-4-2, or 3-8-3, meaning 1 engine 2 cargo 1 engine.
rules-13=Trains are Left Hand Drive (LHD) only, this means trains drive on the left side of the tracks.
